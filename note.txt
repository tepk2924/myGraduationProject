1. By now, I created total two unet model.
2. I make 'virtual dataset' mimicking real photo by rendering several objects
3. First model (unet_model_improveddataset) with first dataset was made using IPA-3D1K dataset, DTD dataset fully.
4. Second model with second dataset was made and this time I created scene with a table + a floor with given prepared floor + table textures. (In comparison, firsr dataset only contained floor, not table.)

--Things that can be invalid
    A pile of chain rope
    A pile of electric wire
    A knitted small basket
    A grid tray
    A gridded pencil holder
    A mini fan

1. Second model & dataset showed terrible (almost every pixel is background.)
2. I am going to make third unet model & dataset. Upon creation, I will not use any of 3D objects out of Thingi10K. Since these objects generally have more complex geometry than those of IPA-3D1K, it will make some invalid texture look like valid.

1. To approach the problem numerically, I am going to take a real photo of scene containing 1 to 5 object, with various textures, and label them whether it is valid texture for grasping with suction cup or not.

1. Taking real photo & labelling (not only validity, I also labelled them with type of each object such as "Thread", "Pencil Case", etc.) was done.
2. I test the first and the third model with real photo & depth map. The first model have tendency of judging invalid pixel of photo as valid, and vice versa for the third model.
3. Now I want to make some "middle point" of these two models(1st, 3rd)....
