1. By now, I created total two unet model.
2. I make 'virtual dataset' mimicking real photo by rendering several objects
3. First model (unet_model_improveddataset) was made using IPA-3D1K dataset, DTD dataset, and ...

--Things that can be invalid
    A pile of chain rope
    A pile of electric wire
    A knitted small basket
    A grid tray
    A gridded pencil holder
    A mini fan

1. I am going to make new unet model. Upon creation, I will not use any of 3D objects out of Thingi10K. Since these objects generally have more complex geometry than those of IPA-3D1K, it will make some invalid texture look like valid.
